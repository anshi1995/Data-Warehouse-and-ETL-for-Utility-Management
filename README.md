# Data-Warehouse-and-ETL-for-Utility-Management
The project involves building a data warehouse and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for efficient utility management. The project aims to integrate and transform data from various sources, including utility providers and the city's building management system, into a single data warehouse. The ETL pipeline has been designed to automate the data ingestion process and ensure data quality. The project results in a centralized data repository for utility data that can be used for reporting, analysis, and decision-making.
